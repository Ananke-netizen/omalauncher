# Omalauncher

An Android home screen with the look of [Omarchy](https://omarchy.org), and an
optional Arch Linux ARM system next to your phone apps. Omalauncher runs the
system under proot, without root, and is its Wayland compositor: every Linux
window opens as its own Android task, with its own card in Recents.

- **Themes**: all 22 Omarchy themes, with their wallpapers, applied to the
  launcher and to the Linux apps, plus the community themes from
  [omarchy.org/themes](https://omarchy.org/themes/), or your own in
  `~/.config/omarchy/themes`
- **Widgets** written in OWL, a small declarative language you can edit on the
  phone, plus a [widget store](https://github.com/SimonSchubert/omarchy-widgets)
- **Linux, optional**: pacman and the AUR, Linux apps in their own windows,
  terminal widgets, a file manager, and opt-in GPU acceleration on Mali GPUs
- **Coding agents**: the bar at the bottom sends a prompt to Claude Code, Codex,
  Copilot, opencode and others, which open in a terminal
- **Feed**: swipe right from the first home page for Hacker News' top 50, tech
  accounts on X, and tech and news sites, in the theme's colors
- No account, no ads, no tracking

Needs an arm64 phone with Android 10 or newer. Without Linux, the launcher still
has the themes, wallpapers, Android apps and the widgets that don't run commands.

## Using it

The bar: the one input at the bottom of the home screen opens apps and asks
coding agents. Focusing it opens the list of Linux and Android apps; typing
narrows the list, and Enter opens the highlighted app or sends the text to the
agent. Short queries that name an app open it, sentences go to the agent; Tab
and the arrow keys move the highlight. Tap the agent's name to pick another
installed one; the choice is saved in `~/.config/omalauncher/agent`. Hold the mic to talk and release to send, or tap it to dictate
into the field. Speech is recognized by Android (on the device when the phone
supports it), so only text reaches Linux.

The feed: swipe right on the first home page (or press Super+F) and a feed
slides in from the left, like Pixel's Discover: Hacker News, recent posts from
tech accounts on X, and headlines from tech and news sites, one tab each and all
of them together. Tap a story to open it, its `[123]` for the discussion; swipe
it back or press Back to close it. Long-press empty home space to turn it on or
off; settings › feed picks the sources, the X accounts, muted words and how
often it refreshes. X has no free API for reading, so its posts come through
FxTwitter's open API (api.fxtwitter.com), which now and then misses an account.

Touch input in Linux windows: tap is a left click, long press is a right
click, drag scrolls; apps with touch support (foot, GTK) get real touch.
Hardware keyboard shortcuts: Super+Enter (terminal), Super+Space or
Super+A (the bar), Super+1..9 (home pages), Super+F (the feed; inside it r,
s, q, 1..5, j/k) on the home screen; Super+Enter
and Super+W (close) in Linux windows.

## Building

`scripts/dev.sh setup` gets a machine ready (JDKs, SDK packages, proot, an
emulator) and `scripts/dev.sh doctor` says what's missing; see
[docs/DEVELOPMENT.md](docs/DEVELOPMENT.md). By hand:

```sh
./scripts/fetch-proot.sh          # Termux's proot -> app/src/main/jniLibs (needs bsdtar)
./gradlew :app:installDebug
# optional: skip the 830 MB download on the device
adb push ArchLinuxARM-aarch64-latest.tar.gz /sdcard/Android/data/dev.omalauncher/files/
```

Tests: `./gradlew :owl:test :app:testDebugUnitTest`. `./gradlew :owl:owlJar`
builds `owl/build/cli/owl.jar`, the checker the widget store's CI runs.

In debug builds you can launch guest commands with
`adb shell am start -n dev.omalauncher/.MainActivity --es exec foot`.

## Layout

- `app/`: the Android app (Kotlin, Jetpack Compose, and the JNI bridge in `src/main/cpp`)
- `owl/`: the widget language and the `owl` command line, plain Kotlin
- `art/`: SVG masters for the app, agent and store icons
- `store/`: Play listing sources (screenshot frames, privacy policy)
- `fastlane/`: the Play listing and the upload lanes
- `scripts/`: fetching proot and theme colors, rendering icons, screenshots and widget previews
